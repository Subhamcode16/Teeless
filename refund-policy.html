      <h2>Returns</h2>
      <p>
        You have 30 calendar days to return an item from the date you received
        it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the
        same condition that you received it.
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it and notify you
        of the status of your refund. If approved, your refund will be
        processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit
        card or original method of payment within a certain number of days.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for
        returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.
      </p>
